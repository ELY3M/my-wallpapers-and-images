The first step is to delete all pixel (bitmap) information. 
Do this by selecting the pixel information and pressing the  delete button  on your keyboard. 
After the pixel information has been deleted, you will need to select all of the design elements (Ctrl A.) 
Then in the top menu bar, go to Object/Flatten Transparency. 
On the settings, slide the bar to 100% vector, and check the  Convert all Text to Outlines  
and also check the  Convert all Strokes to Outlines . Next, go to the Pathfinder and click on the  
Merge option. If you don’t see the Pathfinder palette, go to Window/Pathfinder. To finish up, 
go to Object/Path/Clean Up, and check all three boxes and click OK.
